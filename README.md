**README**

There are two different ways to run our solution. One of which is using Jupyter Notebook and the other is to run the python file 

(This guide assumes that you have jupyter notebook installed and / or python3
aswell as Sklearn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and statistics. If you have not yet installed these you can install these using e.g:  `conda install scikit-learn`, `conda install scikit-learn` or  `conda install jupyter notebook`.



If you would like to run the Jupyter notebook:
1. Go to your Terminal / Shell environment
2. Direct your terminal to the location of the file(s)
3. Then you can use the command:  `jupyter notebook`  in order to open a jupyter notebook environment which allows you to then run the file
4. The file is called ImpactInstitute2.ipynb
5. Then you can run through the code using the play button on top.

If you would like to run the .py file:
1. Open your terminal/ Shell environment
2. Got to your directory where the files are hosted `CD` then drag the folder
3. Run using `python3 impact_institute.py`
4. You will then be prompted for an organization id, once your press enter and this is a valid organisation id you will receive the prediction for 2021 and a graph of this prediction.
